I'm Oluwadara Adedeji, you can call me Dara. I am a machine learning researcher and budding data science and machine learning professional. Welcome to my page!

- ðŸ”­ My PhD. research is on assessing mental health based on financial behaviour via statistical and machine learning methods. I am interested in AI applications and my engineering background has influenced this interest.
- ðŸŒ± I have experience in data science, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics amongst others as seen from projects in my Github. I am currently learning [data engineering](https://github.com/peter716/data_engineering_credit_fraud_project) and MLOPs. 
- ðŸ‘¯ My goal is to see data science and machine learning models transcend Jupyter notebooks, to actual deployment to solve real life problems. Iâ€™m very willing to collaborate on this.
- âš¡ Personal life: When I am not researching or writing code, I relax by surfing the net, listening to music and seeing adventure/thriller series and documentaries, as well as sports(soccer and athletics). My personal goal is to be happy, whatever life throws at me, and to spread happiness as well.
